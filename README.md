# RAINTREE PHP + MYSQL homework

in this project I followed the instructions to demonstrate my skills using PHP and MYSQL

## Setting Up Your Local Environment

You will need to have [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) installed and configured.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
3. Populate the `.env` file with your database credentials:
```bash
DB_SERVER=your_server_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```
4. build the database by:
    * opening the mysql console while in the root directory
    ```bash
    mysql
    ```
    * running the following command:
    ```bash
    source setup.sql 
    ```
Now you are all set to test out the programm.
